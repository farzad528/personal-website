#### Intro

I am a technology professional at [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/) where I work on developing business-enabling digital solutions across the oil and gas value chain to eliminate pain-points that my customers face and make them feel inspired to do the work they do and go home feeling fulfilled by the work that they accomplish. My primary job functions are as a data scientist and software engineer.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in energy transition and sustainability. I enjoy building web and mobile applications and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Houston but willing to travel to U.S based locations.

#### Currently

At Chevron, I have learned how to work across diverse teams across multiple levels of leadership, build relationships with customers, lead agile software development teams, serve as a Front-Developer SME, support critical petrotechnical enterprise applications, and build AI/ML and Software Engineering organization capability for the numerous functions. I've also served on the technical committee in the Offshore Operators Committee Blockchain Oil and Gas Consortium efforts (see [blockchainforenergy.net](https://www.blockchainforenergy.net/)).

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

- In 2019, I visited: Czech Republic, Austria, and U.K.

- In 2020, there was a pandemic and I traveled nowhere.

#### Fun facts

- I got slapped in the face by a monkey.
- I got tricked into eating a Ghost Pepper and didn't find it spicy. #BringOnTheHeat

#### I dream of

- enabling a brighter future for developing countries
- having a beer with Elon Musk.
- continously improving myself.
- seeing my six-pack abs for the first time in a decade.
